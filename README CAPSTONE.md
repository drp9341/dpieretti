# Capstone Project: Cyclistic Case Study
## Introduction:
As part of the Google Data Analytics Specialization, I undertook a Capstone Project to demonstrate the technical skills I acquired during the course, including SQL, Tableau, and R. For this project, I chose to analyze the 'Cyclistic Case Study'.

## Background:
Cyclistic is a fictitious bike-share company operating in Chicago, providing over 6000 bikes at 800+ docking stations across the city. The company serves two customer segments: Casual riders and Members with annual subscriptions. The marketing department seeks to convert Casual riders into Annual Members, and I was tasked with answering the question, "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"

## Technical Approach:
To conduct the analysis, I employed SQL and Tableau as my primary technical tools. SQL allowed me to explore and clean the dataset, while Tableau facilitated the creation of insightful data visualizations.

For the SQL queries used in the pre-cleaning exploration and the cleaning/analysis phases, you can refer to the following links:

By analyzing Cyclistic's data and creating data-driven visualizations, I aimed to provide valuable insights to the marketing team, enabling them to develop an effective campaign to achieve their business objective.
